    <br>
    <b>Background.</b><br>
    <br>
    In working with many different RNA-Seq data sets, we found that
    accurate estimation of expression levels is still a difficult task,
    mainly due to these reasons: there is variability in the sequencing
    experiments, which can distort read counts depending on the
    abundance of the underlying transcripts. As a result, it is unclear
    how to interpret the results, and in particular what distribution to
    use when quantifying the statistical significance at which genes
    might be differentially expressed. Using any <i>ad hoc</i>
    distribution, such as the negative binomial distribution, for the
    only reason that "it fits better and models biological variation" is
    rather unsatisfying, and leaves the question as to what causes this
    "biological variation" open. With MOOSE<sup>2</sup>, we sought to
    address these issues, including exploring a more biologically (or
    perhaps even thermodynamically) relevant model to determine
    significant differences.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Algorithms.</b><br>
    <br>
    The program performs multiple steps that are chained via a pipeline:<br>
    <br>
    1. Identify "reference genes" for normalization.<br>
    <br>
    MOOSE<sup>2</sup> performs a dynamic programming (DP) step to find
    the cheapest path from the most lowly expressed gene to the most
    highly expressed one. Known reference genes can here serve as "way
    points" to guide the process and make it more accurate, even though
    the algorithm seems to perform quite well without. The purpose of
    this step is to identify genes and transcripts that do not vary in
    expression, even though their FPKM or RPKM values might appear quite
    different in the beginning. The assumption behind using DP for this
    task is that genes that are regulated differently depending on
    condition, time point etc., are regulated to varying degrees, i.e.
    some go up or down dramatically, whereas others are less regulated.
    Unregulated genes, on the other hand, should appear similar to each
    other, as long as their overall expression levels are similar, so
    that DP can find a string of these genes by minimizing the distance
    between them, but allowing for gradual change with increasing
    expression. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    2. Polynomial fit to the data.<br>
    <br>
    MOOSE<sup>2</sup> fits a quadratic function to the data, thus
    correcting different ranges of expression differently. While a
    quadratic function is not theoretically justified, it is one way to
    apply a correction that depends on the abundance of transcription.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    3. Estimate the distribution.<br>
    <br>
    MOOSE<sup>2</sup> performs a least-square fit minimization of the
    log differences of FPKM/RPKM values to a convolution of a Laplace
    and a Gauss distribution, based on comparing biological replicates.
    In bacteria and plants, we found that the dominant component of the
    distribution is the Laplace part, which is also used to model
    time-dependent processes, such as the Brownian motion of particles,
    or movement in the stock market. The Gauss part, on the other hand,
    might model the true statistical variation that is reasonly to be
    expected in any experiment.<br>
    <br>
    Ideally, each condition should have at least two replicates,
    however, there is some indication that even a small number of
    replicates can provide enough data points for accurate estimation of
    the parameters.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    4. Estimate the significance.<br>
    <br>
    MOOSE<sup>2</sup> estimates the significance based on the
    distribution described above, allowing for comparisons of multiple
    replicates against multiple replicates. MOOSE<sup>2</sup> tests for
    up- and down-regulation and computes two p-values (or e-values)
    respectively, reflecting the combined probability of a gene
    expressed significantly differentially in two conditions. Note that
    these p-values are typically lower than the values computed by other
    methods, so that using lower cut-off values for differential
    expression is recommended (&lt;10<sup>-10</sup>). <br>
